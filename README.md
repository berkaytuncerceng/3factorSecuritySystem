*3-Factor Authentication System for R&D Centers*

This project is targeted at improving the security of R&D centers by providing a 3-factor authentication system. It combines three layers of user verification: PIN code entry, facial recognition, and fingerprint scanning. The system ensures that only authorized personnel can access sensitive information by using modern and secure authentication methods. The project is built using C# and ASP.NET Core MVC, with the integration of biometric technologies and strong hashing techniques to store user credentials safely.
