*3-Factor Authentication System for R&D Centers*

This project is designed to enhance security for Research and Development (R&D) centers through a 3-factor authentication system. It combines three layers of user verification: PIN code entry, facial recognition, and fingerprint scanning. The system ensures only authorized personnel can access sensitive information by utilizing secure and modern authentication methods. The project is built using C# and ASP.NET Core MVC, with integration of biometric technologies and strong hashing techniques to store user credentials safely.
